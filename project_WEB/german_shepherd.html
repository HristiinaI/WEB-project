        German Shepherd Puppies: Everything You Need to Know
     </h1>

     <p>
        Not surprisingly, German shepherds are one of the most popular breeds of dogs in the U.S. With their physical and mental stamina, this celebrated animal is appreciated by many. With German shepherd puppies, however, their “guard dog” instincts haven’t kicked in yet. Instead, these pups want to play all day, every day. These adorable animals love learning, affection, and bonding closely with their humans.

        German shepherds come from, you guessed it, Germany! A relatively new breed, they didn’t come on the scene until the late 1800s. A German cavalry officer, Captain Max von Stephanitz, spent his life promoting this breed because he loved how versatile and intelligent they were. From their popularity throughout the decades, famous German shepherd puppies like Rin Tin Tin from the 1920s became part of pop-culture history.

    <h2>
        Who is the best human for a German shepherd?
    </h2>
    <p>
        German shepherds love being a part of a high-energy family or with someone who leads an active life. A sedentary lifestyle doesn’t work for this herding breed, as they love to learn, play, and be a part of their human pack! German shepherd puppies can get distracted easily. Even though they love children and family life, while training, it’s best to have them focus only on the task they’re learning so as to avoid sensory overload.
        German shepherds are a tried and true family dog. They love swimming (even with their humans!), running, and romping in a big backyard. They’re highly social and friendly dogs, so a busy household works well for them. They also need plenty of affection and snuggles. Due to their hunting heritage, they love to play fetch!
