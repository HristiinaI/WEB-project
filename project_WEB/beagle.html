        Beagle Puppies: Everything You Need to Know
     </h1>

     <p>
        One of the most popular hound dogs for centuries, beagles let you know exactly what they need and when they need it. Arguably, the word beagle comes from the French word “bégueule,” which can translate into “loudmouth.” Beagles are very vocal animals and use their voices regularly! They’ll tell you about everything from wanting food to seeing a squirrel. Beagle puppies bring a fun-loving and energetic spirit to your family home.
        Originally from England, beagles date back as early as the 1300s. They were used for trailing rabbits and became excellent hunter and tracker companions. In fact, beagles are well-known for their killer sense of scent. They have over 220 million scent receptors! Due to this, they’re able to pick up information about the environment that we could only imagine.

         <td>Though there are two sizes of beagles, this breed fills out every square inch. They’re sturdy, healthy dogs with a large personality. Their coat has a wide variety of colors, with red, white, lemon, and tricolor being most represented. Large brown eyes and long ears give a beagle’s face a distinctive and memorable look. </td>

       <tr>
         <td style="font-family:Impact, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif"> Grooming and Health Needs</td>
         <td>Beagles have a dense double coat that gets thicker in the winter, thus spring is a heavy shedding season. Having a weekly brushing session to remove loose hair helps the coat remain healthy and promotes new growth too. Due to the smooth coat, only minimal bathing is necessary.  
             While at the vet, ask about what health issues a beagle might be prone to. Experts suggest getting periodically tested for eye disorders, hip dysplasia, epilepsy, hypothyroidism, and luxating patella, which is a dislocated kneecap.
